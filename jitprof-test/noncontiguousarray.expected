Report of making non-contiguous array:
 * [location: (jitprof-test/noncontiguousarray.js:3:1:3:7)] <- No. usages: 1
...
Number of putting non-contiguous array statements: 1
[****]NonContArray: 1
Why: In order to handle large and sparse arrays, there are two types of array storage internally:
	 * Fast Elements: linear storage for compact key sets
	 * Dictionary Elements: hash table storage otherwise
It's best not to cause the array storage to flip from one type to another.
